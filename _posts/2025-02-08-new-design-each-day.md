I am searching for ways to keep origami feeling fresh.  Recently, I have spent most of my folding time designing models.  Doing so is a very different experience than folding other people's designs. When designing, much of the time is spent in front of the computer.  It can be tedious. Sometimes designing feels like it sucks the joy out of folding.  To try to breath life back into my folding experience, I have started folding new designs from other people as often as possible.  I'm sure I won't be able to truly fold a new design each day, but that goal serves as a reminder that folding new models is exciting.
