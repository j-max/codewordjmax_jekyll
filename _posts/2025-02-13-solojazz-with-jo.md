I am taking a solo jazz dance class by Jo Hoffberg on iLindy.  She records herself dancing for about 10 minutes using variations on a series of jazz steps.  I completed the Tacky Annie video today.  

I am struck by how much variation one move can handle. Hoffberg fills up an entire song with one move, without it getting boring.  Prior to the video, I did not think that Tacky Annies were very interesting.  After the video, I realized that Tacky Annies can be the foundation for an entire dance.  A Tackie Annie is a non-weight-transferring step on the odd beats, followed by a weight transfer on the evens. The foot on the odd can extend in any direction, and still maintain the feeling of the Tacky Annie.  Hoffberg encourages the dancer to travel with the step.  I have never moved with a Tacky Annie, so that addition is in itself interesting.
