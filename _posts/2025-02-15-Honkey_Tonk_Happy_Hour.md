Every Friday The Empty Bottle hosts the Honkey Tonk Happy Hour.  The Hoyle brothers play two sets from 5:30 to 7:30.  It is magnificent. 

It took me a little while to get comfortable with two-stepping.  I have slowly gotten better at differentiating it from Lindy Hop. 

Most noticeably, the dancers at The Empty Bottle move in a counter-clockwise circle.  Lindy Hop is performed within a general area of the floor, and don't operate on any single axis.

In Lindy Hop, body posture is more athletic, more over the toes, like one were ready to break out in a sprint.  Two-step is relatively more upright. 

The rock-step is also not very common in two-stepping.  Lindy Hop conditioned my body to rock-step frequently.  It is how a Lindy Hopper creates the elastic force that is so crucial to it.  Two-stepping doesn't depend as much on that elasticity.  Stretchiness is there to initiate and complete some moves, but it is less dramatic.

Live music always enhances a dance experience.  The Hoyle Brother's bring it every night.  

The community is welcoming.  People are happy to be there.  

It is the best way to start the weekend.
