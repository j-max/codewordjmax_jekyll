I have been trying for years to figure out how stop hitting the snooze alarm. Some of the techniques I have tried are opening the blinds, drinking water, meditating, going to be earlier.  The list goes on.  I recently started keeping a book by my bed, and when the alarm goes off, I start reading.  It has been suprisingly effective.  Today, for example, I opened up Frankie Manning's biography.  I read a section about him working for the Post Office.  After I opened the book, I didn't worry about the snooze alarm.  

Why this works is complicated. Or at least, it is difficult to describe.  Essentially, when I wake up, emotions are always raw.  Any anxiety or sadness I may feel rears its head, usually more intensely than any other time during the day.  By reading, I am able to distract my mind from these thoughts.  I can turn my mind away from myself, and towards someone else.
