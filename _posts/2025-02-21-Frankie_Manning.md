This morning, I finished *Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop*, by Frankie Manning and Cynthia R. Millman. There was so much good stuff in it. Reading about his life inspires me to learn more about the history of African American dance.  

Frankie Manning says that the Lindy Hop's "basic step is eight counts."[^1] Multiple times in the book, he de-emphasizes counting and emphasizes listening to the music. He says, "The music is counting" for you.[^2] While learning to Lindy Hop, I have gone back and forth with this. I learned a six-count step first (quick-quick, slow, slow), then learned a swing-out, which is the foundational eight-count step Frankie speaks about. As I became comfortable social dancing, I have tried to listen for the start of the measure. I try to emphasize the one count, and in doing so, hope that with this emphasis I start to hear the music better. I have had some fun with this approach. Sometimes it helps me get into a song. But sometimes, this approach messes up the connection with the person I'm dancing with.
