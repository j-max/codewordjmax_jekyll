The main event at Dayton is the team competition, held on Saturday evening.  This year, 13 teams performed choreographed performances.  My team, Traffic Jam Swing, went first, which was a fun experience. It felt like we were setting the tone for the night, which I think we did well, since the rest of the groups were tremendous. The audience was frenetic and super supportive.  It feels to me a bit like it did when I played high school in soccer, but with the excess competitiveness of sports refocused into creativity and community building.  

Here is a video of our performance, danced to a live recording of Earl Hine's "Up Jumped the Devil":

Our team leaders and choreographers, Kerry Kapaku and Cole Crutcher, emphasized formations in the routine. There are plenty of interesting formations, but the big ones were:
-  the Yeet and Meet (01:33), where we launch each other towards center stage to meet with a partner and swing back from where we came.
-  Swing Out City (02:03), where we form a V and use swingout combination to pass the follows down the line. 
- The Binwheel (02:37), where we form a star and rotate while executing Susie Q's. We then continue rotating in a linked Trucking formation.  (Note, the Binwheel would have been named the Pinwheel, but Cole's computer lost its p-key).

If you aren't familiar with Lindy Hop, swingouts, the dance's most iconic move, happen throughout our routine. We perform our first swingouts right after the walk up (00:50), then pepper them in throughout. 

Two other Chicago teams competed as well: Second City Swing and The Windy City Lindy Hoppers.  The Windy City Lindy Hoppers took first place. Both teams' videos are linked below.

The Smackdown is such a great experience. Highly recommend you try out next year if you are a Chicago-area Lindy Hopper.
