Woke up late today, after a late night dancing to The Angry Ankles. My body is having trouble getting going, and I'm reminded of the end of Tracy Smith's poem, "Charity".  She describes watching a woman's determined progress up an uphill street:

	I am you, one day out of five,
	Tired, empty, hating what I carry
	But afraid to lay it down, stingy,
	Angry, doing violence to others
	By the sheer freight of my gloom, 
	Halfway home, wanting to stop, to quit
	But keeping going mostly out of spite.
