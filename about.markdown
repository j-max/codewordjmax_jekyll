I am an artist living in Chicago practicing origami, dance, and poetry.  This site showcases my origami designs, as well as hosts a blog about a variety of interests.  Thank you for visiting. 

None of the posts on this blog are AI generated.  I have chosen not to use AI in any way.  I will not use it for grammar or spelling. I will not use it for ideation.  This is not because I am entirely anti-AI.  Rather, AI runs counter to a couple of personal goals.  Firstly, I want to become a better writer.  If I were to use AI for grammar or to improve organization, I think my development as a writer would be slower.  Maybe there is a technique of using it that would expedite my growth, but at the present moment, I think the old fashioned way is faster.  Secondly, another goal of blogging is to use writing to change how I think about different subjects.  AI could help clarify ideas into a more polished final form, but I think that, in general, it stunts one's growth as a critical thinker.  Producing content which is entirely my own and making it public will, I believe, help me become a better thinker more quickly.
